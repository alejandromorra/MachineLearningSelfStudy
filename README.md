# MachineLearningSelfStudy

## High-Level Process
1. Import Packages and Data
2. Clean Data (Format, Shape and Relevant Columns)
3. Hypothesis
4. Correlation Check
5. Spliting Test and Train Data (20/80 Rule)
6. Train Fit Data
7. View and Adjust Predictions (Ask if must be +, -, and/or rounded)
8. Calculate Errors to validate model
9. Ways to improve model ( More predictors, observations, other models, subsetting this data) 

### Import Libaries and data 
1. Import pandas as pd
2. import numpy as np
3. Import seaborn as sns
4. from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
5. from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
